        <h2>Description</h2>
        I modified Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal cookies very slightly. I came up with something that my boyfriend went CRAZY over! I've never seen him enjoy cookies to that extent! He said I blew his mother's recipe away.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>0.5 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1.25 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 165 degrees C.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix in the quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        
        </ol>
